# clustering_practice

I found two channels based on the six categories from this grocery store. In the first cluster Milk, Groceries, and Detergents_paper were highlighted. In the second cluster, there seems to be some kind of cafe or deli establishment rather than a grocery store. The features Fresh, Frozen, and Delicatessen were proportionally higher in range compared to the features Milk, Grocery and Detergents_paper which correlates with the latent features observed in dimension two of the PCA analysis.
